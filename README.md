This repository contains templates to use to deploy Kubeflow with the DeployKF project.
It is to be used as reference examples and does not aim to be a out of the box ready solution.

- FluxCD needs to be bootstrapped on your cluster to deploy the infra components
- Example sealed secrets are shown as templetes but needs to be recreated in a new cluster
- AWS S3 buckets with the right IAM permissions need to be created and made accessible from the cluster
